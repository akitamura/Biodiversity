# Biodiversity Overview

For this challenge we were tasked with creating a dashboard to visualize Belly Button Bacteria Biodiversity based on a given json dataset. The dashboard was created using javascript and plotly. The dashboard allows viewers to select a sample number from a drop down menu to view.

### Software used

-HTML

-Javascript

-Plotly

### Output

A pie chart of the proportion of the top 10 samples showing their OTU ID  bacteria info
A bubble chart to see OTU_IDs vs. the sample value with the size of the bubble determined by the sample value
Note: A gauge chart was attempted to show the amount of belly button scrubs per week, but output would not properly update. Thus in the code, you will find some attempt to create a guage chart that does not output on the dashboard.
